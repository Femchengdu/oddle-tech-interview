# Frontend challenge

## Instruction

1. Allocate around 4 hours on this project and fork this repository
2. Create a single page application that consumes github search API (e.g. https://api.github.com/search/users?q=tom)
3. Host your production ready application on Heroku/Now and send us the link
4. Create a pull request to this repository
 
## Requirements

- It should have a search bar to let the user search by username
- It should display a list of users along with their images after the search
- When clicking on a user, it should go to another page and display the detailed information of the user from the payload.
- The new page should display the repositories that belong to that user (use repo_url to get that list)
- Use [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
- Use one of the CSS preprocessors or CSS-in-JS
- Your app has to be responsive
- It has to support at least 2 latest version of Chrome and Firefox
- The code should be production ready (__HINT:__ Googleâ€™s PageSpeed Tool)
 
## Bonus point
- Use AWS instead of Heroku/Now
- Support IE10 and/or Android native browser (Chrome 30.0)
- Support server-side rendering and caching
